There are two general strategies to improve something: _select the best_ and _reject the worst_. In this article I will compare the two, and explain why the former often works better.

## Two strategies
- _Select the best_: Decide what you like most about work.
Emphasize it. Remove the worst only in service of emphasizing the best.

- _Reject the worst_: Decide what you dislike about your work.
Try to remove it.


The problems with this approach:

- There is often no good boundary between 'good enough' and bad.
After removing the worst, you may feel compelled the remove the next-worst part. When you're not careful removing weed, you might just kill the flowers in the process.

- Focusing on the worst is demoralizing. Losing motivation makes the work a chore. Something that isn't fun is very hard to stick to.
