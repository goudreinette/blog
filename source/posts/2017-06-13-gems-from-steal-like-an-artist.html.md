I just finished [Steal Like an Artist](http://austinkleon.com/steal/) by Austin Kleon.
It's a short little book, but it contains some valuable ideas.
Here's what I took away from it.

<!-- more -->

> You are, in fact, a mashup of what you choose to let into your life. You are the sum of your influences.

> Your job is to collect ideas.
> The more you read, the more you can choose to be influenced by.

> Keep a snippets folder, wherein you store what you took from others. See something worth stealing? Put it in your snippets folder. Looking for some inspiration? Open your snippets folder.

> If you steal from one author it's plagiarism; if you steal from many it's research. <cite>Wilson Mizner</cite>

> Do the work you want to see done.

> Create with your hands. Publish/finish with the computer.

> Keep all passions in your life. Do not leave your longings unattended.

> The work you do while you procrastinate is probably the work you should be doing for the rest of your life. <cite>Jessica Hische</cite>

> Don't worry about unity: what unifies your work, is the fact that you made it.

> When the world looks new, your brain works harder.

> When you discover you're the most talented person in the room, start looking for a new room.

> Keep a praise folder.

> Nothing is more paralyzing than the idea of limitless possibilities.

> What an artist decides to leave out is often what makes the art interesting.
