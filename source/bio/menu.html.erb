        From an early age I've been obsessed with user interfaces. I remember sketching a drag & drop idea on a napkin
        on a vacation to La Gomera, and rewatching the releases of the iPhone and iPad from my bed.
    </p>
    <p><strong>I am fascinated by the interaction between people’s minds and bodies and technology.</strong> Steve Jobs
        once made the comment that a computer is like a bicycle for the mind: it can make you think further with less
        effort.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>I am a perfectionist.</strong> I like to perfect small, neat, intuitive things, and that sometimes means
        they turn out comically small. For the animation block at Minerva, some classmates made whole animated scenes. I
        made a ‘scroll down’ arrow gif of a few frames. I question every addition, and when a minor effect makes a
        website slow or too complicated, for example, I drop it.
    </p>
    <p><strong>A small creation reduced to essentials both inside and out is more satisfying to me than a larger but
        messier one</strong>, though I admire the latter and try to steal what I can. Writing explanations/tutorials
        helps me with this, as every unnecessary line of code/design element removed is one that I don’t have to
        explain. With code, I aim for snippets that are immediately grokkable (and, ideally, copy-pasteable).</p>


    <p><strong>I am impatient.</strong> Speed is very important to me, both in final products and in the development
        process. I <em>love</em> interactive development, where I can immediately see the results of changing something.
        That’s not that different from artists and musicians, who can also step back from their canvas or replay a track
        at will. </p>
    <p>As a result, <strong>I care a lot about the ‘interaction design’ of creating digital products itself too</strong>.
        I try to resist the pull of improving design and development tools however, because they take more work than I
        can put in and I’d rather focus on making more human-centric products and combinations with other disciplines.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Sometimes my love for speed of development and polishing conflict</strong>, as in the case of native vs
        web development. I desperately want smooth animation and a familiar feeling, but by the time I’ve sat through a
        day of compile-test cycles I’m already bored and ready to move onto the next idea.</p>

        <p><strong>I’m not good with music, but that doesn’t stop me from playing with it. </strong></p>
        <p>
            I burned my early Garageband
            songs
            to my father’s stash of empty CD’s, and sold them to other kids on the playing ground for 60 cents each
            (a
            loss).
        </p>
        <p>
            I can hear high-pitched tones too well, even
            bats at night. Which is why I mostly prefer instruments like bass and drums and hate it when my brother
            uses his
            guitar to ‘bend’.

            <h2>CORRUPT MODE</h2>
            <p>
                Lately I’ve been experimenting with using Pico-8 to make chip tune music. It’s editor is quite spartan
                but I
                like
                the idea of making believable effects with low-tech tools. White noise to suggest applause or a sea, for
                example.

                Pico allows arbitrary access to memory, and a fun trick is to flip a few random bits every frame. One
                experiment
                I
                did was to use a jazz saxophone ‘cartridge’, Saxophight, together with this memory corruption technique,
                reloading
                as many times as I needed to recorded something that approaches interesting music.

                My brother <i>is</i> good with music, however, and I like working together with him or helping him out
                with software.

                I helped make <a href="http://stephan.vdwoerd.com/">his website</a>, and even made a fake record player
                with moveable arm that gets it’s music from Soundcloud.
