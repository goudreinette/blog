Why care: know what makes a good tool, see the overlap. readers will be able to find more effective tools and understand their creative process better.

Most creative achievements are the result of a long series of iterations.

While playing with music production last night I noticed a parallel between music production, design and programming.
Both are creative.
Both require many iterations to get something good.
Both are ideally expressed in the language of the domain.
In both cases, rapid feedback is essential in order to catch mistakes quickly.
Slow feedback disturbs creative thought.

Rapid Feedback => Fast iteration time, reduced frustration

    - information
    - speed

- Type systems
    - declarative specification
    - typechecker detects logical inconsistencies

- Tests
    - help catch mistakes
    - may provide a specification of system

- Repl
    - rapid feedback interaction with code

- Macro's
    - increase expressiveness of language
    - enable solving problem in language of the domain

- Libraries
    - increased expressiveness by allowing you to forget about lowlevel functionality
