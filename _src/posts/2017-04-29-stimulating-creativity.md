Wikipedia defines creativity as _a phenomenon whereby something new and somehow valuable is formed._

Here's what I personally found useful.

## Get lots of intellectual input
I try to get a wide variety of intellectual input, such as programming, writing and personal development blogs, non-fiction books on a variety of topics, design, music, and meetups/conferences. This not only generates ideas, but sometimes also produces an interesting cross-breeding of disciplines.

- Can't connect things you don't know about
- More input, better output
- Look critically at other solutionss
- Read in and around your space


## Optimize for flow
- Flow state
- Distraction reference

It's probably no surprise that avoiding interruptions is essential while you're in active problem solving mode. 

Block email notifications, phone on night mode, tell people you will be gone.

- notepad ready, master your tools
- purpose, challenge, sufficient time
- enviroment: music yes/no, stimulation, 
- Ideas can be generated at will if you wish by brainstorming.


## Take regular breaks
Many people get their best ideas in the shower.
Away from email and ...
Taking a break also helps you lose the fixation on a particular solution, different solutions, bigger picture, sometimes not necessary at all.
Switch around when stuck.



## State the problem
<!-- Rich Hickey's [Hammock Driven Development]() is an awesome talk.
Hickey emphasizes the importance of thinking before running off to code.
The process  -->


- Programming (or any creative work) is solving problems
- Understand the problem
- What do you know?
- What don't you know? (there should be question marks)
- Write down and map out the details and constraints of the problem
- tradeoffs
    - enumerate two or more possible solutions
    - and attributes and deficits of eachs 
- questions
- problems in solutions
- other solutions to similar problems:
    - most likely 
    - get up to speed quicker
- Load alternating parts into your brain:  swap in/out of memory
    - Limited memory capacity: 7 +- 2


- Generate lots of ideas: easier to split the two up. Just like drafting/editing


## Sleep on it
Waking mind is good at

- tactics
- analysis
- use to feed work to background mind
    - and analyze it's products

Background mind is good at

- Good at making connections
    - synthesis
    - strategy
    - abstracts, analogizes
- solver of most non-trivial problems
    - unfortunately cannot direct it


- As we sleep, our brain processes the information we have learned during the day.
- Sleep makes memories stronger, weeds out irrelevant details and background information so that only the important pieces remain
- Brain works during sleep to find hidden relations among memories and to solve problems we were working on while awake


- Relax, sleep, nap with your eyes closed. "Cake is in the oven"
- Often, when you wake up you will be notified of the solution
- Not always the solution you hoped for, but that's fine
- Be ready to capture it

At least one night, sometimes longer.


## Capture inspiration
I try to capture any idea, as bad as it may be.
Bad ideas often lead to good ideas down the road.
May also be combined into better ideas, and nice to know where I stand.
See hammock driven development.

Notebooks are still one of my favorite tools, because free form drawing, pleasant to use, no distractions.
Trello idea board for better organization and tracking. App is fast, important for ideas.
Not always have a notebook on me.
Evernote is also useful for web clips and scans of sketches I don't want to lose, but app is slow and clunky.

## Analyze, select and eliminate

- Waking mind
- Analytical goggles
- Verify idea behind computer/other creative tool
    - With confidence
- Few ideas will be good in the end
- When non-critical, procrastinate on execution


## Cut the knot

- Deadlines: a double edged sword?
- Efficiency vs breadth
- Perfectionism can be a trap
- Sometimes learn-as-you-go better solution (MVP, etc.)
- When costly to adjust, spend more time planning upfront
