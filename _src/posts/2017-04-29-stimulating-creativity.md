Wikipedia defines creativity as _a phenomenon whereby something new and somehow valuable is formed._

Here's what I personally found useful.

## Get lots of intellectual input
I try to get a wide variety of intellectual input, such as programming, writing and personal development blogs, non-fiction books on a variety of topics, design, music, and meetups/conferences. This not only generates ideas, but sometimes also produces an interesting cross-breeding of disciplines.

- Can't connect things you don't know about
- More input, better output
- Look critically at other solutionss
- Read in and around your space


## Optimize for flow

Much has been written about the Flow state.
Avoiding distractions is essential.

Open offices are a nightmare for me, gossiping behind my back wears me out quickly.

Steve Pavlina: 
> If you can’t keep yourself from being disturbed by urgent phone calls, emails, or drop-in visitors, you won’t consistently achieve and maintain the flow state. You must do whatever it takes to prevent unnecessary interruptions during your creative periods. Make arrangements to ensure you won’t be disturbed except in an absolute emergency.

Block email and slack notifications, phone on night mode, tell people you will be gone. Ignore or deal with distraction. Noise blocking headphones are useful for to have for emergency situations.

The right level of [stimulation](https://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2014/12/stimulation/) is also important.
I work better with music, but many people don't. I suggest experimenting with different types of music to see what effect it has on your ability to reach and maintain the flow state.

Purpose


To awaken your full creative potential, the difficulty of your creative endeavor must fall within a certain challenge spectrum. If you consider a task too hard or too complicated, your beliefs will get in the way of your creativity, and you’ll end up with a self-fulfilling prophecy of failure.  Tackling something that’s too easy is mind-numbingly boring and won’t produce results. Being properly challenged is more fun, helps you grow, and yields a meaningful sense of accomplishment.

Make sure you have sufficient time on your hands, ideally 6+ hours.
When you're in the flow state, you'll barely notice the passing of time.
High level creative work is usually a top priority, and it’s a real downer to finally hit the flow state and have to stop after 30 minutes because you must attend to another commitment. 

You should also know your tools well enough to consistently enter the flow state.
Learn your editor's keybindings, and follow a touch typing course if you can't do that yet.
A good pen and notepad are also a must-have, and a very cost effective upgrade.

If you lack ideas, know that they can be generated at will by brainstorming.
I usually do this on paper to avoid distractions, because brainstorming can be tough.


## Take regular breaks
When you get stuck or start to get tired, hungry, etc, take a break.
I recommend remaining disconnected from email, social media, and other distractions if possible. When you give your mind a true break, the solution will often pop up within 15 minutes.

Taking a break also helps you lose the fixation on a particular solution, see the bigger picture, and image other solutions. Sometimes the problem doesn't need to be solved at all.

When you're still feeling stuck after a break, I recommend switching to a different task or calling it a day. Trying to push forward when an approach clearly isn't working can be very frustrating and demotivating. Know when to cut your losses.


## State the problem
<!-- Rich Hickey's [Hammock Driven Development]() is an awesome talk.
Hickey emphasizes the importance of thinking before running off to code.
The process  -->


- Programming (or any creative work) is solving problems
- Understand the problem
- What do you know?
- What don't you know? (there should be question marks)
- Write down and map out the details and constraints of the problem
- tradeoffs
    - enumerate two or more possible solutions
    - and attributes and deficits of eachs 
- questions
- problems in solutions
- other solutions to similar problems:
    - most likely 
    - get up to speed quicker
- Load alternating parts into your brain:  swap in/out of memory
    - Limited memory capacity: 7 +- 2


- Generate lots of ideas: easier to split the two up. Just like drafting/editing


## Sleep on it
Waking mind is good at

- tactics
- analysis
- use to feed work to background mind
    - and analyze it's products

Background mind is good at

- Good at making connections
    - synthesis
    - strategy
    - abstracts, analogizes
- solver of most non-trivial problems
    - unfortunately cannot direct it


- As we sleep, our brain processes the information we have learned during the day.
- Sleep makes memories stronger, weeds out irrelevant details and background information so that only the important pieces remain
- Brain works during sleep to find hidden relations among memories and to solve problems we were working on while awake


- Relax, sleep, nap with your eyes closed. "Cake is in the oven"
- Often, when you wake up you will be notified of the solution
- Not always the solution you hoped for, but that's fine
- Be ready to capture it

At least one night, sometimes longer.


## Capture inspiration
I try to capture any idea, as bad as it may be.
Bad ideas often lead to good ideas down the road.
May also be combined into better ideas, and nice to know where I stand.
See hammock driven development.

Notebooks are still one of my favorite tools, because free form drawing, pleasant to use, no distractions.
Trello idea board for better organization and tracking. App is fast, important for ideas.
Not always have a notebook on me.
Evernote is also useful for web clips and scans of sketches I don't want to lose, but app is slow and clunky.

## Analyze, select and eliminate

- Waking mind
- Analytical goggles
- Verify idea behind computer/other creative tool
    - With confidence
- Few ideas will be good in the end
- When non-critical, procrastinate on execution


## Cut the knot

- Deadlines: a double edged sword?
- Efficiency vs breadth
- Perfectionism can be a trap
- Sometimes learn-as-you-go better solution (MVP, etc.)
- When costly to adjust, spend more time planning upfront
