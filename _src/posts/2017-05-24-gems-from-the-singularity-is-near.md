The book I'm currently reading is [The Singularity is Near: When Humans Transcend Biology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Singularity_Is_Near) by Ray Kurzweil.
It contains an optimistic perspective on the outcome of the ever-increasing rate of technological progress. 
Here are some gems I discovered wile reading.

<!-- more -->


> Pure randomness becomes predictable in its pure lack of predictability

> Chaos provides the variability to permit an evolutionary process to discover more powerful and efficient solutions.

> Innovation is multiplicative, not additive

> There are no hard problems, only problems that are hard to a certain level of intelligence.

> Move the smallest bit upwards in level of intelligence, and some problems will suddenly move from "impossible" to "obvious." Move a substantial degree upwards, and all of them will become obvious.
